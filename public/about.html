<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Chekwube Ezeufo, and I live and work in the United Kingdom. I'm an enthusiastic individual who delight in exploring different ways to utilise technologies to serve the human population. I have gone through various experiences and trainings that honed me the skills as an IT Technician. However, I have found that I'm more attracted to using strange characters and numbers to give instructions to machines. My keen interest in web development has propelled me to take on courses in HTML file, CSS, and JavaScript and I have used them in various ways to infuse beauty on web pages.</p>

<p>I love every bit of the steps I take through this process; the mental stress, mental stimulation, several hours of staring at the screen, and the joy of accomplishing a task. I wouldn't have asked for a better field. It is interesting and at the same time fulfilling to know that the efforts I put in to get to where I am today were not for nothing, rather have created to-do-more attitude in me.</p>

<p>I'm ready to take on more responsibilities and collaborate with other professionals to work out difficult tasks, embark on new discoveries, and design and deliver high quality projects that will stand a test of time. I'm also willing to share my ideas, strength, and skills with an organisation that has an amazing workplace culture and remarkable reputation.
